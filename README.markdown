# Realm

Realm is a library for to help write applications with Domain-Driven Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing, in Ruby. The code is currently bundled up in the project I'm extracting it from. I'm just registering v0.0.1 of the gem as a placeholder until I get chance to extract it properly.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'realm'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install realm
